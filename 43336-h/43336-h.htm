<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/drop001_t.png" width="164" height="155" alt="T" title="T" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">There</span> was once a child
who was untidy. He
left his books on the
floor, and his muddy
shoes on the table;
he put his fingers in
the jam-pots, and spilled
ink on his best pinafore;
there was really no end to his untidiness.</p>

<p>One day the Tidy Angel came into his
nursery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This will never do!&rdquo; said the Angel.
&ldquo;This is really shocking. You must go
out and stay with your brother while I
set things to rights here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no brother!&rdquo; said the child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have!&rdquo; said the Angel. &ldquo;You
may not know him, but he will know you.
Go out in the garden and watch for him,
and he will soon come.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean!&rdquo; said
the child; but he went out into the garden
and waited.</p>

<p>Presently a squirrel came along, whisking
his tail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you my brother?&rdquo; asked the child.</p>

<p>The squirrel looked him over carefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I should hope not!&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;My fur is neat and smooth, my nest is
handsomely made, and in perfect order,
and my young ones are properly brought
up. Why do you insult me by asking
such a question?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He whisked off, and the child waited.</p>

<p>Presently a wren came hopping by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you my brother?&rdquo; asked the child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No indeed!&rdquo; said the wren. &ldquo;What
impertinence! You will find no tidier
person than I in the whole garden. Not
a feather is out of place, and my eggs
are the wonder of all for smoothness and
beauty. Brother, indeed!&rdquo; He hopped
off, ruffling his feathers, and the child
waited.</p>

<p>By and by a large Tommy Cat came
along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you my brother?&rdquo; asked the child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Go and look at yourself in the glass,&rdquo;
said the Tommy Cat haughtily, &ldquo;and you
will have your answer. I have been washing
myself in the sun all the morning,
while it is clear that no water has come
near you for a long time. There are no
such creatures as you in my family, I am
humbly thankful to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He walked on, waving his tail, and the
child waited.</p>

<p>Presently a pig came trotting along.</p>

<p>The child did not wish to ask the pig
if he were his brother, but the pig did not
wait to be asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo, brother!&rdquo; he grunted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not your brother!&rdquo; said the child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you are!&rdquo; said the pig. &ldquo;I
confess I am not proud of you, but there
is no mistaking the members of our family.
Come along, and have a good roll in the
barnyard! There is some lovely black
mud there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to roll in mud!&rdquo; said the
child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell that to the hens!&rdquo; said the pig
brother. &ldquo;Look at your hands, and your
shoes, and your pinafore! Come along,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
I say! You may have some of the pig-wash
for supper, if there is more than I
want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want pig-wash!&rdquo; said the child;
and he began to cry.</p>

<p>Just then the Tidy Angel came out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have set everything to rights,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;and so it must stay. Now, will
you go with the Pig Brother, or will you
come back with me, and be a tidy child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With you, with you!&rdquo; cried the child;
and he clung to the Angel&rsquo;s dress.</p>

<p>The Pig Brother grunted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Small loss!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There will be
all the more wash for me!&rdquo; and he trotted
on.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_GOLDEN_WINDOWS" id="THE_GOLDEN_WINDOWS">THE GOLDEN WINDOWS</a></h2>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/drop005_a.png" width="164" height="125" alt="A" title="A" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">All</span> day long the little boy
worked hard, in field and
barn and shed, for his people
were poor farmers, and
could not pay a workman;
but at sunset there came
an hour that was all his
own, for his father had given it to him.
Then the boy would go up to the top of
a hill and look across at another hill that
rose some miles away. On this far hill
stood a house with windows of clear gold
and diamonds. They shone and blazed
so that it made the boy wink to look at
them: but after a while the people in the
house put up shutters, as it seemed, and
then it looked like any common farmhouse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
The boy supposed they did this
because it was supper-time; and then he
would go into the house and have his
supper of bread and milk, and so to bed.</p>

<p>One day the boy&rsquo;s father called him and
said: &ldquo;You have been a good boy, and
have earned a holiday. Take this day for
your own; but remember that God gave
it, and try to learn some good thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy thanked his father and kissed
his mother; then he put a piece of bread
in his pocket, and started off to find the
house with the golden windows.</p>

<p>It was pleasant walking. His bare feet
made marks in the white dust, and when
he looked back, the footprints seemed to
be following him, and making company
for him. His shadow, too, kept beside
him, and would dance or run with him as
he pleased; so it was very cheerful.</p>

<p>By and by he felt hungry; and he sat
down by a brown brook that ran through
the alder hedge by the roadside, and ate
his bread, and drank the clear water.
Then he scattered the crumbs for the
birds, as his mother had taught him to
do, and went on his way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>After a long time he came to a high
green hill; and when he had climbed the
hill, there was the house on the top; but
it seemed that the shutters were up, for
he could not see the golden windows. He
came up to the house, and then he could
well have wept, for the windows were of
clear glass, like any others, and there was
no gold anywhere about them.</p>

<p>A woman came to the door, and looked
kindly at the boy, and asked him what he
wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw the golden windows from our
hilltop,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I came to see them,
but now they are only glass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman shook her head and laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are poor farming people,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and are not likely to have gold about
our windows; but glass is better to see
through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She bade the boy sit down on the
broad stone step at the door, and brought
him a cup of milk and a cake, and bade
him rest; then she called her daughter,
a child of his own age, and nodded
kindly at the two, and went back to her
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>The little girl was barefooted like himself,
and wore a brown cotton gown, but
her hair was golden like the windows he
had seen, and her eyes were blue like the
sky at noon. She led the boy about the
farm, and showed him her black calf with
the white star on its forehead, and he
told her about his own at home, which
was red like a chestnut, with four white
feet. Then when they had eaten an apple
together, and so had become friends, the
boy asked her about the golden windows.
The little girl nodded, and said she knew
all about them, only he had mistaken the
house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have come quite the wrong way!&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Come with me, and I will
show you the house with the golden windows,
and then you will see for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went to a knoll that rose behind
the farmhouse, and as they went the little
girl told him that the golden windows
could only be seen at a certain hour, about
sunset.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that!&rdquo; said the boy.</p>

<p>When they reached the top of the knoll,
the girl turned and pointed; and there on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
a hill far away stood a house with windows
of clear gold and diamond, just as he had
seen them. And when they looked again,
the boy saw that it was his own home.</p>

<p>Then he told the little girl that he must
go; and he gave her his best pebble, the
white one with the red band, that he had
carried for a year in his pocket; and she
gave him three horse-chestnuts, one red
like satin, one spotted, and one white like
milk. He kissed her, and promised to
come again, but he did not tell her what
he had learned; and so he went back down
the hill, and the little girl stood in the
sunset light and watched him.</p>

<p>The way home was long, and it was
dark before the boy reached his father&rsquo;s
house; but the lamplight and firelight
shone through the windows, making them
almost as bright as he had seen them from
the hilltop; and when he opened the door,
his mother came to kiss him, and his little
sister ran to throw her arms about his
neck, and his father looked up and smiled
from his seat by the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you had a good day?&rdquo; asked his
mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, the boy had had a very good day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And have you learned anything?&rdquo; asked
his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;I have learned
that our house has windows of gold and
diamond.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Some</span> children were at play
in their play-ground one
day, when a herald rode
through the town, blowing
a trumpet, and crying
aloud, &ldquo;The King! the
King passes by this road
to-day. Make ready for the King!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The children stopped their play, and
looked at one another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;The
King is coming. He may look over the
wall and see our playground; who knows?
We must put it in order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The playground was sadly dirty, and
in the corners were scraps of paper and
broken toys, for these were careless children.
But now, one brought a hoe, and
another a rake, and a third ran to fetch
the wheelbarrow from behind the garden
gate. They labored hard, till at length
all was clean and tidy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now it is clean!&rdquo; they said; &ldquo;but we
must make it pretty, too, for kings are
used to fine things; maybe he would not
notice mere cleanness, for he may have it
all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then one brought sweet rushes and
strewed them on the ground; and others
made garlands of oak leaves and pine
tassels and hung them on the walls; and
the littlest one pulled marigold buds and
threw them all about the playground, &ldquo;to
look like gold,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>When all was done the playground was
so beautiful that the children stood and
looked at it, and clapped their hands with
pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us keep it always like this!&rdquo; said
the littlest one; and the others cried,
&ldquo;Yes! yes! that is what we will do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They waited all day for the coming
of the King, but he never came; only,
towards sunset, a man with travel-worn
clothes, and a kind, tired face passed along
the road, and stopped to look over the
wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a pleasant place!&rdquo; said the man.
&ldquo;May I come in and rest, dear children?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The children brought him in gladly, and
set him on the seat that they had made
out of an old cask. They had covered it
with the old red cloak to make it look like
a throne, and it made a very good one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is our playground!&rdquo; they said.
&ldquo;We made it pretty for the King, but he
did not come, and now we mean to keep
it so for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is good!&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we think pretty and clean is
nicer than ugly and dirty!&rdquo; said another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is better!&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And for tired people to rest in!&rdquo; said
the littlest one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is best of all!&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>He sat and rested, and looked at the
children with such kind eyes that they
came about him, and told him all they
knew; about the five puppies in the barn,
and the thrush&rsquo;s nest with four blue
eggs, and the shore where the gold shells
grew; and the man nodded and understood
all about it.</p>

<p>By and by he asked for a cup of water,
and they brought it to him in the best
cup, with the gold sprigs on it: then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
thanked the children, and rose and went
on his way; but before he went he laid
his hand on their heads for a moment,
and the touch went warm to their hearts.</p>

<p>The children stood by the wall and
watched the man as he went slowly along.
The sun was setting, and the light fell in
long slanting rays across the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He looks so tired!&rdquo; said one of the
children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he was so kind!&rdquo; said another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; said the littlest one. &ldquo;How
the sun shines on his hair! it looks like
a crown of gold.&rdquo;</p>

<img src="images/drop017_o.png" width="131" height="129" alt="O" title="O" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> the Play Angel
came into a nursery
where four little children
sat on the floor
with sad and troubled
faces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter,
dears?&rdquo; asked the Play Angel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We wanted to have a grand feast!&rdquo;
said the child whose nursery it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that would be delightful!&rdquo; said
the Play Angel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there is only one cooky!&rdquo; said the
child whose nursery it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it is a very small cooky!&rdquo; said
the child who was a cousin, and therefore
felt a right to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not big enough for myself!&rdquo; said the
child whose nursery it was.</p>

<p>The other two children said nothing,
because they were not relations; but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
looked at the cooky with large eyes, and
their mouths went up in the middle and
down at the sides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Play Angel, &ldquo;suppose
we have the feast just the same! I think
we can manage it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She broke the cooky into four pieces,
and gave one piece to the littlest child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is a roast
chicken, a Brown Bantam. It is just as
brown and crispy as it can be, and there
is cranberry sauce on one side, and on the
other a little mountain of mashed potato;
it must be a volcano, it smokes so. Do
you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said the littlest one; and his
mouth went down in the middle and up
at the corners.</p>

<p>The Play Angel gave a piece to the
next child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is a little pie! Outside,
as you see, it is brown and crusty,
with a wreath of pastry leaves round the
edge and &lsquo;For You&rsquo; in the middle; but
inside it is all chicken and ham and jelly
and hard-boiled eggs. Did ever you see
such a pie?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Never I did!&rdquo; said the child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now here,&rdquo; said the Angel to the
third child, &ldquo;is a round cake. <em>Look</em> at
it! the frosting is half an inch thick, with
candied rose-leaves and angelica laid on
in true-lovers&rsquo; knots; and inside there are
chopped-up almonds, and raisins, and great
slices of citron. It is the prettiest cake
I ever saw, and the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it is I did!&rdquo; said the third child.</p>

<p>Then the Angel gave the last piece to
the child whose nursery it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Just look!
Here is an ice-cream rabbit. He is
snow-white outside, with eyes of red
barley sugar; see his ears, and his little
snubby tail! but inside, I <em>think</em> you will
find him pink. Now, when I clap my
hands and count one, two, three, you
must eat the feast all up. One&mdash;two&mdash;three!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the children ate the feast all up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said the Angel. &ldquo;Did ever
you see such a grand feast?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, never we did!&rdquo; said all the four
children together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there are some crumbs left over,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
said the Angel. &ldquo;Come, and we will give
them to the brother birds!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t have any!&rdquo; said the
child whose nursery it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said the Angel. &ldquo;I had
it all!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/drop021_s.png" width="129" height="129" alt="S" title="S" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Some</span> children were set
to reap in a wheat-field.
The wheat was yellow
as gold, the sun shone
gloriously, and the butterflies
flew hither and
thither. Some of the
children worked better, and some worse;
but there was one who ran here and there
after the butterflies that fluttered about
his head, and sang as he ran.</p>

<p>By and by evening came, and the Angel
of the wheat-field called to the children
and said, &ldquo;Come now to the gate, and
bring your sheaves with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the children came, bringing their
sheaves. Some had great piles, laid close
and even, so that they might carry more;
some had theirs laid large and loose, so
that they looked more than they were;
but one, the child that had run to and fro
after the butterflies, came empty-handed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>The Angel said to this child, &ldquo;Where
are your sheaves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child hung his head. &ldquo;I do not
know!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I had some, but I
have lost them, I know not how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None enter here without sheaves,&rdquo; said
the Angel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; said the child. &ldquo;But
I thought I would like to see the place
where the others were going; besides, they
would not let me leave them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then all the other children cried out
together. One said, &ldquo;Dear Angel, let him
in! In the morning I was sick, and this
child came and played with me, and
showed me the butterflies, and I forgot
my pain. Also, he gave me one of his
sheaves, and I would give it to him again,
but I cannot tell it now from my own.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p>THE WHEAT FIELD.</p>

<p class="plc">[<i>Page 22.</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Another said, &ldquo;Dear Angel, let him in!
At noon the sun beat on my head so
fiercely that I fainted and fell down like
one dead; and this child came running by,
and when he saw me he brought water
to revive me, and then he showed me the
butterflies, and was so glad and merry
that my strength returned; to me also he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
gave one of his sheaves, and I would give
it to him again, but it is so like my own
that I cannot tell it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And a third said, &ldquo;Just now, as evening
was coming, I was weary and sad, and
had so few sheaves that it seemed hardly
worth my while to go on working; but
this child comforted me, and showed me
the butterflies, and gave me of his sheaves.
Look! it may be that this was his; and
yet I cannot tell, it is so like my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And all the children said, &ldquo;We also had
sheaves of him, dear Angel; let him in,
we pray you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Angel smiled, and reached his hand
inside the gate and brought out a pile
of sheaves; it was not large, but the glory
of the sun was on it, so that it seemed to
lighten the whole field.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here are his sheaves!&rdquo; said the Angel.
&ldquo;They are known and counted, every one.&rdquo;
And he said to the child, &ldquo;Lead the way
in!&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Mother</span>,&rdquo; said
the child; &ldquo;are
there really angels?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Good
Book says so,&rdquo;
said the mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the child; &ldquo;I have seen
the picture. But did you ever see one,
mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I have,&rdquo; said the mother; &ldquo;but
she was not dressed like the picture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to find one!&rdquo; said the
child. &ldquo;I am going to run along the road,
miles, and miles, and miles, until I find an
angel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be a good plan!&rdquo; said the
mother. &ldquo;And I will go with you, for
you are too little to run far alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not little any more!&rdquo; said the
child. &ldquo;I have trousers; I am big.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are!&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;I
forgot. But it is a fine day, and I should
like the walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you walk so slowly, with your
lame foot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can walk faster than you think!&rdquo;
said the mother.</p>

<p>So they started, the child leaping and
running, and the mother stepping out so
bravely with her lame foot that the child
soon forgot about it.</p>

<p>The child danced on ahead, and presently
he saw a chariot coming towards
him, drawn by prancing white horses.
In the chariot sat a splendid lady in
velvet and furs, with white plumes waving
above her dark hair. As she moved
in her seat, she flashed with jewels and
gold, but her eyes were brighter than her
diamonds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you an angel?&rdquo; asked the child,
running up beside the chariot.</p>

<p>The lady made no reply, but stared
coldly at the child: then she spoke a word
to her coachman, and he flicked his whip,
and the chariot rolled away swiftly in a
cloud of dust, and disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The dust filled the child&rsquo;s eyes and
mouth, and made him choke and sneeze.
He gasped for breath, and rubbed his
eyes; but presently his mother came up,
and wiped away the dust with her blue
gingham apron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was not an angel!&rdquo; said the child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;Nothing
like one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child danced on again, leaping and
running from side to side of the road,
and the mother followed as best she
might.</p>

<p>By and by the child met a most beautiful
maiden, clad in a white dress. Her
eyes were like blue stars, and the blushes
came and went in her face like roses looking
through snow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure you must be an angel!&rdquo; cried
the child.</p>

<p>The maiden blushed more sweetly than
before. &ldquo;You dear little child!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;Some one else said that, only last evening.
Do I really look like an angel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <em>are</em> an angel!&rdquo; said the child.</p>

<p>The maiden took him up in her arms
and kissed him, and held him tenderly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the dearest little thing I ever
saw!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Tell me what makes
you think so!&rdquo; But suddenly her face
changed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;There he is, coming
to meet me! And you have soiled
my white dress with your dusty shoes,
and pulled my hair all awry. Run away,
child, and go home to your mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She set the child down, not unkindly,
but so hastily that he stumbled and fell;
but she did not see that, for she was hastening
forward to meet her lover, who was
coming along the road. (Now if the
maiden had only known, he thought her
twice as lovely with the child in her arms;
but she did not know.)</p>

<p>The child lay in the dusty road and
sobbed, till his mother came along and
picked him up, and wiped away the tears
with her blue gingham apron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that was an angel, after
all,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;But she may
be one some day. She is young yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am tired!&rdquo; said the child. &ldquo;Will
you carry me home, mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes!&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;That
is what I came for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child put his arms round his mother&rsquo;s
neck, and she held him tight and trudged
along the road, singing the song he liked
best.</p>

<p>Suddenly he looked up in her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose
<em>you</em> could be an angel, could you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a foolish child!&rdquo; said the
mother. &ldquo;Who ever heard of an angel
in a blue gingham apron?&rdquo; and she went
on singing, and stepped out so bravely on
her lame foot that no one would ever have
known she was lame.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/drop029_o.png" width="150" height="128" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time a boy
played about the house,
running by his mother&rsquo;s
side; and as he
was very little, his
mother tied him to the
string of her apron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when you stumble,
you can pull yourself up by the apron-string,
and so you will not fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy did that, and all went well,
and the mother sang at her work.</p>

<p>By and by the boy grew so tall that his
head came above the window-sill; and
looking through the window, he saw far
away green trees waving, and a flowing
river that flashed in the sun, and rising
above all, blue peaks of mountains.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;untie the
apron-string and let me go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the mother said, &ldquo;Not yet, my
child! only yesterday you stumbled, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
would have fallen but for the apron-string.
Wait yet a little, till you are stronger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the boy waited, and all went as before;
and the mother sang at her work.</p>

<p>But one day the boy found the door of
the house standing open, for it was spring
weather; and he stood on the threshold
and looked across the valley, and saw the
green trees waving, and the swift-flowing
river with the sun flashing on it, and the
blue mountains rising beyond; and this
time he heard the voice of the river calling,
and it said &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the boy started forward, and as
he started, the string of the apron broke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! how weak my mother&rsquo;s apron-string
is!&rdquo; cried the boy; and he ran out
into the world, with the broken string
hanging beside him.</p>

<p>The mother gathered up the other end
of the string and put it in her bosom, and
went about her work again; but she sang
no more.</p>

<p>The boy ran on and on, rejoicing in his
freedom, and in the fresh air and the
morning sun. He crossed the valley, and
began to climb the foothills among which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the river flowed swiftly, among rocks and
cliffs. Now it was easy climbing, and
again it was steep and craggy, but always
he looked upward at the blue peaks beyond,
and always the voice of the river
was in his ears, saying &ldquo;Come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>By and by he came to the brink of a
precipice, over which the river dashed in
a cataract, foaming and flashing, and sending
up clouds of silver spray. The spray
filled his eyes, so that he did not see his
footing clearly; he grew dizzy, stumbled,
and fell. But as he fell, something about
him caught on a point of rock at the
precipice-edge, and held him, so that he
hung dangling over the abyss; and when
he put up his hand to see what held him,
he found that it was the broken string of
the apron, which still hung by his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! how strong my mother&rsquo;s apron-string
is!&rdquo; said the boy: and he drew
himself up by it, and stood firm on his
feet, and went on climbing toward the
blue peaks of the mountains.</p>

came to see what
ailed it. He found
the little one sitting
on the ground, with
the sun at its back
(for the day was young), looking at its
own shadow, which lay on the ground
before it, and weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ails you, little one?&rdquo; asked the
Angel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The world is so dark!&rdquo; said the child.
&ldquo;See, it is all dusky gray, and there is no
beauty in it. Why must I stay in this
sad, gray world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you not hear the birds singing, and
the other children calling at their play?&rdquo;
asked the Angel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the child; &ldquo;I hear them,
but I do not know where they are. I
cannot see them, I see only the shadow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Moreover, if they saw it, they would not
sing and call, but would weep as I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Angel lifted the child, and set it on
its feet, with its face to the early sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said the Angel.</p>

<p>The child brushed away the tears from
its eyes and looked. Before them lay the
fields all green and gold, shining with
dewdrops, and the other children were
running to and fro, laughing and shouting,
and crowning one another with
blossoms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, there are the children!&rdquo; said the
little one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Angel; &ldquo;there they
are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the sun is shining!&rdquo; cried the

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Angel; &ldquo;it was shining
all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the shadow is gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> upon a time two children
came to the house
of a sailor man, who
lived beside the salt
sea; and they found the
sailor man sitting in his
doorway knotting ropes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; asked the sailor
man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are very well, thank you,&rdquo; said the
children, who had learned manners, &ldquo;and
we hope you are the same. We heard
that you had a boat, and we thought that
perhaps you would take us out in her, and
teach us how to sail, for that is what we
wish most to know.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;All in good time,&rdquo; said the sailor man.
&ldquo;I am busy now, but by and by, when my
work is done, I may perhaps take one of
you if you are ready to learn. Meantime
here are some ropes that need knotting;
you might be doing that, since it has to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
be done.&rdquo; And he showed them how the
knots should be tied, and went away and
left them.</p>

<p>When he was gone the first child ran
to the window and looked out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is the sea,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
waves come up on the beach, almost
to the door of the house. They run
up all white, like prancing horses, and
then they go dragging back. Come and
look!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; said the second child. &ldquo;I
am tying a knot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried the first child, &ldquo;I see the
boat. She is dancing like a lady at a
ball; I never saw such a beauty. Come
and look!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; said the second child. &ldquo;I
am tying a knot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall have a delightful sail in that
boat,&rdquo; said the first child. &ldquo;I expect that
the sailor man will take me, because I am
the eldest and I know more about it.
There was no need of my watching when
he showed you the knots, because I knew
how already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then the sailor man came in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my work is over.
What have you been doing in the
meantime?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been looking at the boat,&rdquo; said
the first child. &ldquo;What a beauty she is!
I shall have the best time in her that ever
I had in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been tying knots,&rdquo; said the
second child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, then,&rdquo; said the sailor man, and
he held out his hand to the second child.
&ldquo;I will take you out in the boat, and teach
you to sail her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am the eldest,&rdquo; cried the first
child, &ldquo;and I know a great deal more
than she does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said the sailor man;
&ldquo;but a person must learn to tie a knot
before he can learn to sail a boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have learned to tie a knot,&rdquo; cried
the child. &ldquo;I know all about it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I tell that?&rdquo; asked the sailor
man.</p>

<p>She went away about her own work, for
she was very industrious; but the little boy
sat still, and thought himself ill-used.</p>

<p>By and by his mother came into the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, little boy?&rdquo; she

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> a child was sitting
on a great log that
lay by the roadside,
playing; and another
child came
along, and stopped to
speak to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; asked the
second child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sailing to the Southern Seas,&rdquo;
replied the first, &ldquo;to get a cargo of monkeys,
and elephant tusks, and crystal balls
as large as oranges. Come up here, and
you may sail with me if you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the second child climbed upon the
log.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said the first child. &ldquo;See
how the foam bubbles up before the ship,
and trails and floats away behind! Look!
the water is so clear that we can see the
fishes swimming about, blue and red and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
green. There goes a parrot-fish; my
father told me about them. I should not
wonder if we saw a whale in about a
minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; asked
the second child, peevishly. &ldquo;There is no
water here, only grass; and anyhow this
is nothing but a log. You cannot get to
islands in this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we <em>have</em> got to them,&rdquo; cried the
first child. &ldquo;We are at them now. I see
the palm-trees waving, and the white sand
glittering. Look! there are the natives
gathering to welcome us on the beach.
They have feather cloaks, and necklaces,
and anklets of copper as red as gold.
Oh! and there is an elephant coming
straight toward us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think you would be ashamed,&rdquo;
said the second child. &ldquo;That is Widow
Slocum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same,&rdquo; said the first child.</p>

<p>Presently the second child got down
from the log.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to play stick-knife,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any sense in this. I
think you are pretty dull to play things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
that aren&rsquo;t really there.&rdquo; And he walked
slowly away.</p>

<p>The first child looked after him a
moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think <em>you</em> are pretty dull,&rdquo; he said
to himself, &ldquo;to see nothing but what is
under your nose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he was too well-mannered to say
this aloud; and having taken in his cargo,
he sailed for another port.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">One</span> day a man was walking
along the street, and he
was sad at heart. Business
was dull; he had
set his desire upon a
horse that cost a thousand
dollars, and he had only eight
hundred to buy it with. There were other
things, to be sure, that might be bought
with eight hundred dollars, but he did
not want those; so he was sorrowful, and
thought the world a bad place.</p>

<p>As he walked, he saw a child running
toward him; it was a strange child, but
when he looked at it, its face lightened
like sunshine, and broke into smiles. The
child held out its closed hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess what I have!&rdquo; it cried gleefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something fine, I am sure!&rdquo; said the
man.</p>

<p>The child nodded and drew nearer; then
opened its hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; it said; and the street rang

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; said the child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>Then they parted, and the child went
and bought a stick of candy, and saw all
the world red and white in stripes.</p>

<p>The man went and put his eight hundred
dollars in the savings-bank, all but
fifty cents, and with the fifty cents he
bought a hobby-horse for his own little
boy, and the little boy saw all the world
brown, with white spots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this the horse you wanted so to
buy, father?&rdquo; asked the little boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the horse I have bought!&rdquo; said

<h2><a name="BUTTERCUP_GOLD" id="BUTTERCUP_GOLD">BUTTERCUP GOLD</a></h2>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/drop048_o.png" width="150" height="164" alt="O" title="O" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Oh!</span> the cupperty-buts!
and oh! the cupperty-buts!
out in
the meadow, shining
under the trees, and
sparkling over the
lawn, millions and
millions of them,
each one a bit of purest
gold from Mother Nature&rsquo;s mint. Jessy
stood at the window, looking out at them,
and thinking, as she often had thought
before, that there were no flowers so
beautiful. &ldquo;Cupperty-buts,&rdquo; she had
been used to call them, when she was a
wee baby-girl and could not speak without
tumbling over her words and mixing them
up in the queerest fashion; and now that
she was a very great girl, actually six
years old, they were still cupperty-buts
to her, and would never be anything else,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
she said. There was nothing she liked
better than to watch the lovely golden
things, and nod to them as they nodded
to her; but this morning her little face
looked anxious and troubled, and she
gazed at the flowers with an intent and inquiring
look, as if she had expected them
to reply to her unspoken thoughts. What
these thoughts were I am going to tell you.</p>

<p>Half an hour before, she had called
to her mother, who was just going out,
and begged her to come and look at the
cupperty-buts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are brighter than ever, Mamma!
Do just come and look at them! golden,
golden, golden! There must be fifteen
thousand million dollars&rsquo; worth of gold
just on the lawn, I should think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And her mother, pausing to look out,
said, very sadly,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my darling! if I only had this
day a little of that gold, what a happy
woman I should be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then the good mother went out,
and there little Jessy stood, gazing at
the flowers, and repeating the words to
herself, over and over again,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If I only had a little of that gold!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She knew that her mother was very,
very poor, and had to go out to work every
day to earn food and clothes for herself
and her little daughter; and the child&rsquo;s
tender heart ached to think of the sadness
in the dear mother&rsquo;s look and tone. Suddenly
Jessy started, and the sunshine
flashed into her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;why shouldn&rsquo;t
I get some of the gold from the cupperty-buts?
I believe I could get some, perfectly
well. When Mamma wants to get the
juice out of anything, meat, or fruit, or
anything of that sort, she just boils it.
And so, if I should boil the cupperty-buts,
wouldn&rsquo;t all the gold come out? Of
course it would! Oh, joy! how pleased
Mamma will be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jessy&rsquo;s actions always followed her
thoughts with great rapidity. In five
minutes she was out on the lawn, with
a huge basket beside her, pulling away
at the buttercups with might and main.
Oh! how small they were, and how long
it took even to cover the bottom of the
basket. But Jessy worked with a will,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and at the end of an hour she had picked
enough to make at least a thousand
dollars, as she calculated. That would
do for one day, she thought; and now
for the grand experiment! Before going
out she had with much labor filled the
great kettle with water, so now the water
was boiling, and she had only to put the
buttercups in and put the cover on. When
this was done, she sat as patiently as she
could, trying to pay attention to her
knitting, and not to look at the clock
oftener than every two minutes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must boil for an hour,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;and by that time all the gold will have
come out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well, the hour did pass, somehow or
other, though it was a very long one;
and at eleven o&rsquo;clock, Jessy, with a mighty
effort, lifted the kettle from the stove and
carried it to the open door, that the fresh
air might cool the boiling water. At first,
when she lifted the cover, such a cloud
of steam came out that she could see
nothing; but in a moment the wind blew
the steam aside, and then she saw,&mdash;oh,
poor little Jessy!&mdash;she saw a mass of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
weeds floating about in a quantity of
dirty, greenish water, and that was all.
Not the smallest trace of gold, even in the
buttercups themselves, was to be seen.
Poor little Jessy! she tried hard not to
cry, but it was a bitter disappointment;
the tears came rolling down her cheeks
faster and faster, till at length she sat
down by the kettle, and, burying her face
in her apron, sobbed as if her heart would
break.</p>

<p>Presently, through her sobs, she heard
a kind voice saying, &ldquo;What is the matter,
little one? Why do you cry so bitterly?&rdquo;
She looked up and saw an old gentleman
with white hair and a bright, cheery face,
standing by her. At first, Jessy could say
nothing but &ldquo;Oh! the cupperty-buts!
oh! the cupperty-buts!&rdquo; but, of course,
the old gentleman didn&rsquo;t know what she
meant by that, so, as he urged her to tell
him about her trouble, she dried her eyes,
and told him the melancholy little story:
how her mother was very poor, and said
she wished she had some gold; and how
she herself had tried to get the gold out
of the buttercups by boiling them. &ldquo;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
was so sure I could get it out,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and I thought Mamma would be so
pleased! And now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here she was very near breaking down
again; but the gentleman patted her head
and said, cheerfully, &ldquo;Wait a bit, little
woman! Don&rsquo;t give up the ship yet.
You know that gold is heavy, very heavy
indeed, and if there were any it would be
at the very bottom of the kettle, all covered
with the weeds, so that you could not see
it. I should not be at all surprised if
you found some, after all. Run into the
house and bring me a spoon with a long
handle, and we will fish in the kettle, and
see what we can find.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jessy&rsquo;s face brightened, and she ran
into the house. If any one had been
standing near just at that moment, I
think it is possible that he might have seen
the old gentleman&rsquo;s hand go into his pocket
and out again very quickly, and might
have heard a little splash in the kettle;
but nobody was near, so, of course, I
cannot say anything about it. At any rate,
when Jessy came out with the spoon, he
was standing with both hands in his pockets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
looking in the opposite direction. He
took the great iron spoon and fished about
in the kettle for some time. At last there
was a little clinking noise, and the old
gentleman lifted the spoon. Oh, wonder
and delight! In it lay three great, broad,
shining pieces of gold! Jessy could hardly
believe her eyes. She stared and stared;
and when the old gentleman put the gold
into her hand, she still stood as if in a
happy dream, gazing at it. Suddenly she
started, and remembered that she had
not thanked her kindly helper. She looked
up, and began, &ldquo;Thank you, sir;&rdquo; but
the old gentleman was gone.</p>

<p>Well, the next question was, How could
Jessy possibly wait till twelve o&rsquo;clock for
her mother to come home? Knitting was
out of the question. She could do nothing
but dance and look out of window, and
look out of window and dance, holding
the precious coins tight in her hand. At
last, a well-known footstep was heard
outside the door, and Mrs. Gray came in,
looking very tired and worn. She smiled,
however, when she saw Jessy, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my darling, I am glad to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
you looking so bright. How has the morning
gone with my little housekeeper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother!&rdquo; cried Jessy, hopping
about on one foot, &ldquo;it has gone very well!
oh, very, <em>very, very</em> well! Oh, my mother
dear, what do you think I have got in
my hand? <em>What</em> do you think? oh,
what <em>do</em> you think?&rdquo; and she went dancing
round and round, till poor Mrs. Gray
was quite dizzy with watching her. At
last she stopped, and holding out her hand,
opened it and showed her mother what
was in it. Mrs. Gray was really frightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jessy, my child!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;where
did you get all that money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out of the cupperty-buts, Mamma!&rdquo;
said Jessy, &ldquo;out of the cupperty-buts!
and it&rsquo;s all for you, every bit of it! Dear
Mamma, now you will be happy, will
you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jessy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gray, &ldquo;have you
lost your senses, or are you playing some
trick on me? Tell me all about this at
once, dear child, and don&rsquo;t talk nonsense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t nonsense, Mamma!&rdquo;
cried Jessy, &ldquo;and it did come out of the
cupperty-buts!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>And then she told her mother the whole
story. The tears came into Mrs. Gray&rsquo;s
eyes, but they were tears of joy and gratitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jessy dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when we say
our prayers at night, let us never forget
to pray for that good gentleman. May
Heaven bless him and reward him! for
if it had not been for him, Jessy dear, I
fear you would never have found the
&lsquo;Buttercup Gold.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">When</span> the spotted cat
first found the nest,
there was nothing in
it, for it was only just
finished. So she said,
&ldquo;I will wait!&rdquo; for she was a patient cat,
and the summer was before her. She waited
a week, and then she climbed up again to
the top of the tree, and peeped into the nest.
There lay two lovely blue eggs, smooth and
shining.</p>

<p>The spotted cat said, &ldquo;Eggs may be
good, but young birds are better. I will
wait.&rdquo; So she waited; and while she
was waiting, she caught mice and rats,
and washed herself and slept, and did
all that a spotted cat should do to pass
the time away.</p>

<p>When another week had passed, she
climbed the tree again and peeped into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
nest. This time there were five eggs.
But the spotted cat said again, &ldquo;Eggs
may be good, but young birds are better.
I will wait a little longer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she waited a little longer and then
went up again to look. Ah! there were
five tiny birds, with big eyes and long
necks, and yellow beaks wide open. Then
the spotted cat sat down on the branch,
and licked her nose and purred, for she
was very happy. &ldquo;It is worth while to
be patient!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>But when she looked again at the young
birds, to see which one she should take
first, she saw that they were very thin,&mdash;oh,
very, very thin they were! The spotted
cat had never seen anything so thin in her
life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;if I were
to wait only a few days longer, they
would grow fat. Thin birds may be good,
but fat birds are much better. I will
wait!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she waited; and she watched the
father-bird bringing worms all day long
to the nest, and said, &ldquo;Aha! they must
be fattening fast! they will soon be as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
fat as I wish them to be. Aha! what a
good thing it is to be patient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At last, one day she thought, &ldquo;Surely,
now they must be fat enough! I will not
wait another day. Aha! how good they
will be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she climbed up the tree, licking her
chops all the way and thinking of the fat
young birds. And when she reached
the top and looked into the nest, it was
empty!!</p>

<p>Then the spotted cat sat down on the
branch and spoke thus, &ldquo;Well, of all the
horrid, mean, ungrateful creatures I ever
saw, those birds are the horridest, and
the meanest, and the most ungrateful!
Mi-a-u-ow!!!!&rdquo;</p>

<span class="upper">Far</span> down in the meadow the wheat grows green,<br />
And the reapers are whetting their sickles so keen;<br />

Far down in the valley the old mill stands,<br />

</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> Quacky Duck
stood on the bank of
the stream. And the
frogs came and sat on
stones and insulted him.
Now the words which
the frogs used were
these,&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Ya! ha! he hasn&rsquo;t any hind-legs!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ya! ha! he hasn&rsquo;t any fore-legs!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! what horrid luck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be a Quacky Duck!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>These were not pleasant words. And
when the Quacky Duck heard them, he
considered within himself whether it would
not be best for him to eat the frogs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two good things would come of it,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I should have a savoury meal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and their remarks would no longer be
audible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he fell upon the frogs, and they fled
before him. And one jumped into the
water, and one jumped on the land, and
another jumped into the reeds; for such
is their manner. But one of them, being
in fear, saw not clearly the way he should
go, and jumped even upon the back of the
Quacky Duck. Now, this displeased the
Quacky Duck, and he said, &ldquo;If you will
remove yourself from my person, we will
speak further of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the frog, being also willing, strove
to remove himself, and the result was that
they two, being on the edge of the bank,
fell into the water. Then the frog departed
swiftly, saying, &ldquo;Solitude is best for
meditation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Quacky Duck, having hit his
head against a stone, sank to the bottom
of the pond, where he found himself in
the frogs&rsquo; kitchen. And there he spied
a fish, which the frogs had caught for
their dinner, intending to share it in a
brotherly manner, for it was a savoury
fish. When the Quacky Duck saw it, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
was glad; and he said, &ldquo;Fish is better
than frog&rdquo; (for he was an English duck)!
And, taking the fish, he swam with speed
to the shore.</p>

<p>Now the frogs lamented when they saw
him go, for they said, &ldquo;He has our savoury
fish!&rdquo; And they wept, and reviled the
Quacky Duck.</p>

<p>But he said, &ldquo;Be comforted! for if I
had not found the fish, I should assuredly
have eaten you. Therefore, say now,
which is the better for you?&rdquo; And he
ate the fish, and departed joyful.</p>

</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">It</span> was a very hot day,
and the little boy was
lying on his stomach
under the big linden
tree, reading the &ldquo;Scottish
Chiefs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little Boy,&rdquo; said his
mother, &ldquo;will you please go out in the garden
and bring me a head of lettuce?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&mdash;can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said the little boy.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;too&mdash;<em>hot</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little boy&rsquo;s father happened to be
close by, weeding the geranium bed; and
when he heard this, he lifted the little boy
gently by his waistband, and dipped him
in the great tub of water that stood ready
for watering the plants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, my son!&rdquo; said the father.
&ldquo;Now you are cool enough to go and get
the lettuce; but remember next time that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
it will be easier to go at once when you
are told, as then you will not have to change
your clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little boy went drip, drip, dripping
out into the garden and brought the lettuce;
then he went drip, drip, dripping into the
house and changed his clothes; but he
said never a word, for he knew there was
nothing to say.</p>

<p>That is the way they do things where
the little boy lives. Would you like to
live there? Perhaps not; yet he is a
happy little boy, and he is learning the
truth of the old saying,&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="NEW_YEAR" id="NEW_YEAR">NEW YEAR</a></h2>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/drop084_t.png" width="134" height="160" alt="T" title="T" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> little sweet Child tied
on her hood, and put
on her warm cloak and
mittens. &ldquo;I am going
to the wood,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;to tell the creatures all
about it. They cannot
understand about Christmas, mamma says,
and of course she knows, but I do think
they ought to know about New Year!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Out in the wood the snow lay light and
powdery on the branches, but under foot it
made a firm, smooth floor, over which
the Child could walk lightly without
sinking in. She saw other footprints
beside her own, tiny bird-tracks, little
hopping marks, which showed where a
rabbit had taken his way, traces of mice
and squirrels and other little wild-wood
beasts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>The child stood under a great hemlock-tree,
and looked up toward the clear blue
sky, which shone far away beyond the
dark tree-tops. She spread her hands
abroad and called, &ldquo;Happy New Year!
Happy New Year to everybody in the
wood, and all over the world!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A rustling was heard in the hemlock
branches, and a striped squirrel peeped
down at her. &ldquo;What do you mean by
that, little Child?&rdquo; he asked. And then
from all around came other squirrels,
came little field-mice, and hares swiftly
leaping, and all the winter birds, titmouse
and snow-bird, and many another; and
they all wanted to know what the Child
meant by her greeting, for they had never
heard the words before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It means that God is giving us
another year!&rdquo; said the Child. &ldquo;Four
more seasons, each lovelier than the last,
just as it was last year. Flowers will bud,
and then they will blossom, and then the
fruit will hang all red and golden on the
branches, for birds and men and little
children to eat.&rdquo; &ldquo;And squirrels, too!&rdquo;
cried the chipmunk, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; said the Child. &ldquo;Squirrels,
too, and every creature that lives in
the good green wood. And this is not
all! We can do over again the things that
we tried to do last year, and perhaps
failed in doing. We have another chance
to be good and kind, to do little loving
things that help, and to cure ourselves
of doing naughty things. Our hearts
can have lovely new seasons, like the
flowers and trees and all the sweet things
that grow and bear leaves and fruit. I
thought I would come and tell you all
this, because sometimes one does not
think of things till one hears them from
another&rsquo;s lips. Are you glad I came?
If you are glad, say Happy New Year!
each in his own way! I say it to you all
now in my way. Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such a noise as broke out then had never
been heard in the wood since the oldest
hemlock was a baby, and that was a long
time ago. Chirping, twittering, squeaking,
chattering! The wood-doves lit on
the Child&rsquo;s shoulder and cooed in her ear,
and she knew just what they said. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
squirrels made a long speech, and meant
every word of it, which is more than
people always do; the field-mouse said
that she was going to turn over a new leaf,
the very biggest cabbage-leaf she could
find; while the titmouse invited the whole
company to dine with him, a thing he
had never done in his life before.</p>

<p>When the Child turned to leave the
wood, the joyful chorus followed her,
and she went, smiling, home and told her
mother all about it. &ldquo;And, mother,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;I should not be surprised if
they had got a little bit of Christmas, after
all, along with their New Year!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/drop072_o.png" width="129" height="129" alt="O" title="O" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Once</span> a Cake would go
seek his fortune in the
world, and he took his
leave of the Pan he was
baked in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know my destiny,&rdquo;
said the Cake. &ldquo;I must
be eaten, since to that end I was made;
but I am a good cake, if I say it who
should not, and I would fain choose the
persons I am to benefit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what difference it makes to
you!&rdquo; said the Pan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But imagination is hardly your strong
point!&rdquo; said the Cake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; said the Pan.</p>

<p>The Cake went on his way, and soon he
passed by a cottage door where sat a
woman spinning, and her ten children playing
about her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;what a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
cake!&rdquo; and she put out her hand to
take him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be so good as to wait a moment!&rdquo;
said the Cake. &ldquo;Will you kindly tell me
what you would do with me if I should
yield myself up to you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall break you into ten pieces,&rdquo; said
the woman, &ldquo;and give one to each of my
ten children. So you will give ten pleasures,
and that is a good thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that would be very nice, I am
sure,&rdquo; said the Cake; &ldquo;but if you will excuse
me for mentioning it, your children
seem rather dirty, especially their hands,
and I confess I should like to keep my
frosting unsullied, so I think I will go a
little further.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you will!&rdquo; said the woman. &ldquo;After
all, the brown loaf is better for the children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the Cake went further, and met a fair
child, richly dressed, with coral lips and
eyes like sunlit water. When the child
saw the Cake, he said like the woman,
&ldquo;Oh, what a beautiful Cake!&rdquo; and put out
his hand to take it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I should be most happy!&rdquo;
said the Cake. &ldquo;And you will not take it
amiss, I am confident, if I ask with whom
you will share me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not share you with any one!&rdquo;
said the child. &ldquo;I shall eat you myself,
every crumb. What do you take me for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; cried the Cake. &ldquo;This
will never do. Consider my size,&mdash;and
yours! You would be very ill!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; said the child. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
rather be ill than give any away.&rdquo; And
he fixed greedy eyes on the Cake, and
stretched forth his hand again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is really terrible!&rdquo; cried the Cake.
&ldquo;What is one&rsquo;s frosting to this? I will go
back to the woman with the ten children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned and ran back, leaving the
child screaming with rage and disappointed
greed. But as he ran, a hungry Puppy
met him, and swallowed him at a gulp,
and went on licking his chops and wagging
his tail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; said the Pan.</p>

</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Chimborazo</span> was a very
unhappy boy. He
pouted, and he sulked,
and he said, &ldquo;Oh, dear!
oh, dear! oh, dear! oh,
dear!&rdquo; He said it till
everybody was tired of
hearing it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chimborazo,&rdquo; his mother would say,
&ldquo;please don&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;Oh, dear!&rsquo; any more.
It is very annoying. Say something else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; the boy would answer,
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t! I don&rsquo;t know anything else to
say. Oh, dear! Oh, <em>dear</em>!! oh, <strong>DEAR</strong>!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>One day his mother could not bear it
any longer, and she sent for his fairy godmother,
and told her all about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said the fairy godmother.
&ldquo;I will see to it. Send the boy to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Chimborazo was sent for, and came,
hanging his head as usual. When he
saw his fairy godmother, he said, &ldquo;Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
dear!&rdquo; for he was rather afraid of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, dear!&rsquo; it is!&rdquo; said the godmother
sharply; and she put on her
spectacles and looked at him. &ldquo;Do
you know what a bell-punch is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; said Chimborazo. &ldquo;No,
ma&rsquo;am, I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the godmother, &ldquo;I am
going to give you one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; said Chimborazo, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably not,&rdquo; replied she, &ldquo;but that
doesn&rsquo;t make much difference. You have
it now, in your jacket pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chimborazo felt in his pocket, and took
out a queer-looking instrument of shining
metal. &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, dear!&rsquo; it is!&rdquo; said the fairy
godmother. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;listen to me, Chimborazo! I am going
to put you on an allowance of &lsquo;Oh, dears.&rsquo;
This is a self-acting bell-punch, and it
will ring whenever you say &lsquo;Oh, dear!&rsquo;
How many times do you generally say
it in the course of the day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; said Chimborazo, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know. Oh, <em>dear</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ting! ting!</em>&rdquo; the bell-punch rang
twice sharply; and looking at it in dismay,
he saw two little round holes punched
in a long slip of pasteboard which was
fastened to the instrument.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; said the fairy. &ldquo;That
is the way it works, and a very pretty
way, too. Now, my boy, I am going to
make you a very liberal allowance. You
may say &lsquo;Oh, dear!&rsquo; forty-five times a
day. There&rsquo;s liberality for you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; cried Chimborazo, &ldquo;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Ting!</em>&rdquo; said the bell-punch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see!&rdquo; observed the fairy. &ldquo;Nothing
could be prettier. You have now
had three of this day&rsquo;s allowance. It is
still some hours before noon, so I advise
you to be careful. If you exceed the
allowance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Here she paused, and
glowered through her spectacles in a
very dreadful manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; cried Chimborazo. &ldquo;What
will happen then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will see!&rdquo; said the fairy godmother,
with a nod. &ldquo;<em>Something</em> will
happen, you may be very sure of that.
Good-by. Remember, only forty-five!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
And away she flew out of the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; cried Chimborazo, bursting
into tears. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it! I won&rsquo;t
have it! Oh, <em>dear</em>! oh, dear! oh, dear!
oh, dear! oh, <strong>DEAR</strong>!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ting! ting! ting-ting-ting-<em>ting</em>!&rdquo;
said the bell-punch; and now there were
ten round holes in the strip of pasteboard.
Chimborazo was now really frightened.
He was silent for some time; and when
his mother called him to his lessons he
tried very hard not to say the dangerous
words. But the habit was so strong that
he said them unconsciously. By dinnertime
there were twenty-five holes in the
cardboard strip; by tea-time there were
forty! Poor Chimborazo! he was afraid
to open his lips, for whenever he did the
words would slip out in spite of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Chimbo,&rdquo; said his father after
tea, &ldquo;I hear you have had a visit from
your fairy godmother. What did she say
to you, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; said Chimborazo, &ldquo;she
said&mdash;oh, dear! I&rsquo;ve said it again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She said, &lsquo;Oh, dear! I&rsquo;ve said it
again!&rsquo;&rdquo; repeated his father. &ldquo;What
do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! I didn&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; cried
Chimborazo hastily; and again the inexorable
bell rang, and he knew that
another hole was punched in the fatal
cardboard. He pressed his lips firmly
together, and did not open them again
except to say &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; until he
was safe in his own room. Then he hastily
drew the hated bell-punch from his pocket,
and counted the holes in the strip of cardboard;
there were forty-three! &ldquo;Oh,
<em>dear</em>!&rdquo; cried the boy, forgetting himself
again in his alarm, &ldquo;only two more!
Oh, <em>dear</em>! oh, <strong>DEAR</strong>! I&rsquo;ve done it again!
oh&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Ting! ting!&rdquo; went the bell-punch;
and the cardboard was punched
to the end. &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; cried Chimborazo,
now beside himself with terror.
&ldquo;Oh, dear! oh, dear! oh, dear! oh,
<em>dear</em>!! what will become of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A strange whirring noise was heard,
then a loud clang; and the next moment
the bell-punch, as if it were alive, flew
out of his hand, out of the window, and
was gone!</p>

<p>Chimborazo stood breathless with terror
for a few minutes, momentarily expecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
that the roof would fall in on his head,
or the floor blow up under his feet, or
some appalling catastrophe of some kind
follow; but nothing followed. Everything
was quiet, and there seemed to be nothing
to do but go to bed; and so to bed he went,
and slept, only to dream that he was shot
through the head with a bell-punch, and
died saying, &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning, when Chimborazo
came downstairs, his father said, &ldquo;My
boy, I am going to drive over to your
grandfather&rsquo;s farm this morning; would
you like to go with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A drive to the farm was one of the
greatest pleasures Chimborazo had, so he
answered promptly, &ldquo;Oh, <em>dear</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well!&rdquo; said his father,
looking much surprised. &ldquo;You need not
go, my son, if you do not want to. I will
take Robert instead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Chimborazo! He had opened his
lips to say, &ldquo;Thank you, papa. I should
like to go <em>very</em> much!&rdquo; and, instead of
these words, out had popped, in his most
doleful tone, the now hated &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo;
He sat amazed; but was roused by his
mother&rsquo;s calling him to breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Chimbo,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Here
are sausages and scrambled eggs: and
you are very fond of both of them. Which
will you have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chimborazo hastened to say, &ldquo;Sausages,
please, mamma,&rdquo;&mdash;that is, he
hastened to <em>try</em> to say it; but all his
mother heard was, &ldquo;Oh, <em>dear</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His father looked much displeased.
&ldquo;Give the boy some bread and water,
wife,&rdquo; he said sternly. &ldquo;If he cannot answer
properly, he must be taught. I have
had enough of this &lsquo;oh, dear!&rsquo; business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Chimborazo! He saw plainly
enough now what his punishment was
to be; and the thought of it made him
tremble. He tried to ask for some more
bread, but only brought out his &ldquo;Oh,
<em>dear</em>!&rdquo; in such a lamentable tone that his
father ordered him to leave the room. He
went out into the garden, and there he met
John the gardener, carrying a basket of
rosy apples. Oh! how good they looked!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am bringing some of the finest apples
up to the house, little master,&rdquo; said John.
&ldquo;Will you have one to put in your pocket?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <em>dear</em>!&rdquo; was all the poor boy could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
say, though he wanted an apple, oh, so
much! And when John heard that he
put the apple back in his basket, muttering
something about ungrateful monkeys.</p>

<p>Poor Chimborazo! I will not give the
whole history of that miserable day,&mdash;a
miserable day it was from beginning to
end. He fared no better at dinner than
at breakfast; for at the second &ldquo;Oh,
dear!&rdquo; his father sent him up to his room,
&ldquo;to stay there until he knew how to take
what was given him, and be thankful
for it.&rdquo; He knew well enough by this
time; but he could not tell his father so.
He went to his room, and sat looking out
of the window, a hungry and miserable boy.</p>

<p>In the afternoon his cousin Will came
up to see him. &ldquo;Why, Chimbo!&rdquo; he
cried. &ldquo;Why do you sit moping here in
the house, when all the boys are out?
Come and play marbles with me on the
piazza. Ned and Harry are out there
waiting for you. Come on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; said Chimborazo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Will.
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you any marbles? Never mind.
I&rsquo;ll give you half of mine, if you like.
Come!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <strong>DEAR</strong>!&rdquo; said Chimborazo.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Will, &ldquo;if that&rsquo;s all you
have to say when I offer you marbles, I&rsquo;ll
keep them myself. I suppose you expected
me to give you all of them, did you?
I never saw such a fellow!&rdquo; and off he
went in a huff.</p>

<p class="tb">. . . . . . . .</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Chimborazo,&rdquo; said the fairy
godmother, &ldquo;what do you think of &lsquo;Oh,
dear!&rsquo; now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chimborazo looked at her beseechingly,
but said nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Finding that forty-five times was not
enough for you yesterday, I thought I
would let you have all you wanted to-day,
you see,&rdquo; said the fairy wickedly.</p>

<p>The boy still looked imploringly at her,
but did not open his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; she said at last, touching
his lips with her wand, &ldquo;I think that is
enough in the way of punishment, though
I am sorry you broke the bell-punch.
Good-by! I don&rsquo;t believe you will say
&lsquo;Oh, dear!&rsquo; any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_USEFUL_COAL" id="THE_USEFUL_COAL">THE USEFUL COAL</a></h2>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/drop084_t.png" width="134" height="160" alt="T" title="T" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">There</span> was once a king
whose name was Sligo.
He was noted both for
his riches and his kind
heart. One evening,
as he sat by his fireside,
a coal fell out on
the hearth. The king
took up the tongs, intending to put it
back on the fire, but the coal said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will spare my life, and do as
I tell you, I will save your treasure three
times, and tell you the name of the thief
who steals it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These words gave the king great joy,
for much treasure had been stolen from
him of late, and none of his officers could
discover the culprit. So he set the coal
on the table, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty little black and red bird, tell
me, what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put me in your waistcoat-pocket,&rdquo; said
the coal, &ldquo;and take no more thought for
to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly the king put the coal in his
pocket, and then, as he sat before the warm
fire, he grew drowsy, and presently fell
fast asleep.</p>

<p>When he had been asleep some time,
the door opened, very softly, and the High
Cellarer peeped cautiously in. This was
the one of the king&rsquo;s officers who had
been most eager in searching for the thief.
He now crept softly, softly, toward the
king, and seeing that he was fast asleep,
put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket;
for in that waistcoat-pocket King Sligo
kept the key of his treasure-chamber,
and the High Cellarer was the thief. He
put his hand into the waistcoat-pocket.
S-s-s-s-s! the coal burned it so frightfully
that he gave a loud shriek, and fell on his
knees on the hearth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; cried the king,
waking with a start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! your Majesty,&rdquo; said the High<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Cellarer, thrusting his burnt fingers into
his bosom, that the king might not see
them. &ldquo;You were just on the point of
falling forward into the fire, and I cried
out, partly from fright and partly to waken
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king thanked the High Cellarer,
and gave him a ruby ring as a reward.
But when he was in his chamber, and
making ready for bed, the coal said to
him:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once already have I saved your
treasure, and to-night I shall save it again.
Only put me on the table beside your bed,
and you may sleep with a quiet heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the king put the coal on the table,
and himself into the bed, and was soon
sound asleep. At midnight the door of
the chamber opened very softly, and the
High Cellarer peeped in again. He knew
that at night King Sligo kept the key under
his pillow, and he was coming to get it.
He crept softly, softly, toward the bed,
but as he drew near it, the coal cried
out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One eye sleeps, but the other eye
wakes! one eye sleeps, but the other eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
wakes! Who is this comes creeping,
while honest men are sleeping?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The High Cellarer looked about him
in affright, and saw the coal burning fiery
red in the darkness, and looking for all
the world like a great flaming eye. In
an agony of fear he fled from the chamber,
crying,&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Black and red! black and red!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The king has a devil to guard his bed.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">And he spent the rest of the night shivering
in the farthest garret he could find.</p>

<p>The next morning the coal said to the
king:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again this night have I saved your
treasure, and mayhap your life as well.
Yet a third time I shall do it, and this time
you shall learn the name of the thief. But
if I do this, you must promise me one thing,
and that is that you will place me in your
royal crown and wear me as a jewel.
Will you do this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will I, right gladly!&rdquo; replied
King Sligo, &ldquo;for a jewel indeed you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is well!&rdquo; said the coal. &ldquo;It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
is true that I am dying; but no matter.
It is a fine thing to be a jewel in a king&rsquo;s
crown, even if one is dead. Now listen,
and follow my directions closely. As
soon as I am quite black and dead,&mdash;which
will be in about ten minutes from
now,&mdash;you must take me in your hand
and rub me all over and around the handle
of the door of the treasure-chamber.
A good part of me will be rubbed off, but
there will be enough left to put in your
crown. When you have thoroughly rubbed
the door, lay the key of the treasure-chamber
on your table, as if you had
left it there by mistake. You may then
go hunting or riding, but not for more
than an hour; and when you return, you
must instantly call all your court together,
as if on business of the greatest importance.
Invent some excuse for asking them to
raise their hands, and then arrest the man
whose hands are black. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do!&rdquo; replied King Sligo, fervently,
&ldquo;I do, and my warmest thanks, good
Coal, are due to you for this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But here he stopped, for already the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
coal was quite black, and in less than ten
minutes it was dead and cold. Then the
king took it and rubbed it carefully over
the door of the treasure-chamber, and laying
the key of the door in plain sight on
his dressing-table, he called his huntsmen
together, and mounting his horse, rode
away to the forest. As soon as he was
gone, the High Cellarer, who had pleaded
a headache when asked to join the hunt,
crept softly to the king&rsquo;s room, and to his
surprise found the key on the table. Full
of joy, he sought the treasure-chamber
at once, and began filling his pockets
with gold and jewels, which he carried
to his own apartment, returning greedily
for more. In this way he opened and
closed the door many times. Suddenly,
as he was stooping over a silver barrel
containing sapphires, he heard the sound
of a trumpet, blown once, twice, thrice.
The wicked thief started, for it was the
signal for the entire court to appear instantly
before the king, and the penalty
of disobedience was death. Hastily cramming
a handful of sapphires into his
pocket, he stumbled to the door, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
he closed and locked, putting the key
also in his pocket, as there was no time
to return it. He flew to the presence-chamber,
where the lords of the kingdom
were hastily assembling.</p>

<p>The king was seated on his throne,
still in his hunting-dress, though he had
put on his crown over his hat, which
presented a peculiar appearance. It was
with a majestic air, however, that he rose
and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobles, and gentlemen of my court!
I have called you together to pray
for the soul of my lamented grandmother,
who died, as you may remember,
several years ago. In token of respect, I
desire you all to raise your hands to
Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The astonished courtiers, one and all,
lifted their hands high in air. The king
looked, and, behold! the hands of the
High Cellarer were as black as soot!
The king caused him to be arrested and
searched, and the sapphires in his pocket,
besides the key of the treasure-chamber,
gave ample proof of his guilt. His head
was removed at once, and the king had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the useful coal, set in sapphires, placed
in the very front of his crown, where it
was much admired and praised as a

<h2><a name="THE_THREE_REMARKS" id="THE_THREE_REMARKS">THE THREE REMARKS</a></h2>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/drop093_t.png" width="129" height="131" alt="T" title="T" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">There</span> was once a
princess, the most
beautiful princess
that ever was seen.
Her hair was black
and soft as the raven&rsquo;s
wing; her eyes
were like stars dropped in a pool of clear
water, and her speech like the first tinkling
cascade of the baby Nile. She was also
wise, graceful, and gentle, so that one would
have thought she must be the happiest
princess in the world.</p>

<p>But, alas! there was one terrible drawback
to her happiness. She could make
only three remarks. No one knew whether
it was the fault of her nurse, or a peculiarity
born with her; but the sad fact remained,
that no matter what was said to her, she
could only reply in one of three phrases.
The first was,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the price of butter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The second, &ldquo;Has your grandmother
sold her mangle yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the third, &ldquo;With all my heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>You may well imagine what a great
misfortune this was to a young and lively
princess. How could she join in the sports
and dances of the noble youths and maidens
of the court? She could not always be
silent, neither could she always say, &ldquo;With
all my heart!&rdquo; though this was her favorite
phrase, and she used it whenever
she possibly could; and it was not at all
pleasant, when some gallant knight asked
her whether she would rather play croquet
or Aunt Sally, to be obliged to reply,
&ldquo;What is the price of butter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>On certain occasions, however, the
princess actually found her infirmity of
service to her. She could always put an
end suddenly to any conversation that did
not please her, by interposing with her
first or second remark; and they were
also a very great assistance to her when,
as happened nearly every day, she received
an offer of marriage. Emperors,
kings, princes, dukes, earls, marquises,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
viscounts, baronets, and many other lofty
personages knelt at her feet, and offered
her their hands, hearts, and other possessions
of greater or less value. But for
all her suitors the princess had but one
answer. Fixing her deep radiant eyes
on them, she would reply with thrilling
earnestness, &ldquo;<em>Has</em> your grandmother sold
her mangle yet?&rdquo; and this always impressed
the suitors so deeply that they
retired, weeping, to a neighboring monastery,
where they hung up their armor
in the chapel, and taking the vows, passed
the remainder of their lives mostly in
flogging themselves, wearing hair shirts,
and putting dry toast-crumbs in their beds.</p>

<p>Now, when the king found that all his
best nobles were turning into monks,
he was greatly displeased, and said to
the princess:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My daughter, it is high time that all
this nonsense came to an end. The next
time a respectable person asks you to
marry him, you will say, &lsquo;With all my
heart!&rsquo; or I will know the reason why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this the princess could not endure,
for she had never yet seen a man whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
she was willing to marry. Nevertheless,
she feared her father&rsquo;s anger, for she knew
that he always kept his word; so that
very night she slipped down the back
stairs of the palace, opened the back door,
and ran away out into the wide world.</p>

<p>She wandered for many days, over
mountain and moor, through fen and
through forest, until she came to a fair
city. Here all the bells were ringing,
and the people shouting and flinging caps
into the air; for their old king was dead,
and they were just about to crown a new
one. The new king was a stranger, who
had come to the town only the day before;
but as soon as he heard of the old monarch&rsquo;s
death, he told the people that he was a
king himself, and as he happened to be
without a kingdom at that moment, he
would be quite willing to rule over them.
The people joyfully assented, for the late
king had left no heir; and now all the
preparations had been completed. The
crown had been polished up, and a new
tip put on the sceptre, as the old king had
quite spoiled it by poking the fire with it
for upwards of forty years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>When the people saw the beautiful
princess, they welcomed her with many
bows, and insisted on leading her before
the new king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who knows but that they may be
related?&rdquo; said everybody. &ldquo;They both
came from the same direction, and both are
strangers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly the princess was led to the
market-place, where the king was sitting
in royal state. He had a fat, red, shining
face, and did not look like the kings whom
she had been in the habit of seeing; but
nevertheless the princess made a graceful
courtesy, and then waited to hear what
he would say.</p>

<p>The new king seemed rather embarrassed
when he saw that it was a princess who
appeared before him; but he smiled
graciously, and said, in a smooth oily
voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust your &rsquo;Ighness is quite well.
And &rsquo;ow did yer &rsquo;Ighness leave yer pa
and ma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At these words the princess raised her
head and looked fixedly at the red-faced
king; then she replied, with scornful
distinctness,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the price of butter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At these words an alarming change came
over the king&rsquo;s face. The red faded
from it, and left it a livid green; his teeth
chattered; his eyes stared, and rolled
in their sockets; while the sceptre dropped
from his trembling hand and fell at the
princess&rsquo;s feet. For the truth was, this
was no king at all, but a retired butterman,
who had laid by a little money at his trade,
and had thought of setting up a public
house; but chancing to pass through this
city at the very time when they were
looking for a king, it struck him that he
might just as well fill the vacant place as
any one else. No one had thought of his
being an impostor; but when the princess
fixed her clear eyes on him and asked him
that familiar question, which he had been
in the habit of hearing many times a day
for a great part of his life, the guilty
butterman thought himself detected, and
shook in his guilty shoes. Hastily descending
from his throne, he beckoned
the princess into a side-chamber, and
closing the door, besought her in moving
terms not to betray him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is a bag of rubies
as big as pigeon&rsquo;s eggs. There are six
thousand of them, and I &rsquo;umbly beg your
&rsquo;Ighness to haccept them as a slight token
hof my hesteem, if your &rsquo;Ighness will
kindly consent to spare a respeckable
tradesman the disgrace of being hexposed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The princess reflected, and came to the
conclusion that, after all, a butterman
might make as good a king as any one else;
so she took the rubies with a gracious little
nod, and departed, while all the people
shouted, &ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; and followed her,
waving their hats and kerchiefs, to the
gates of the city.</p>

<p>With her bag of rubies over her shoulder,
the fair princess now pursued her journey,
and fared forward over heath and hill,
through brake and through brier. After
several days she came to a deep forest,
which she entered without hesitation, for
she knew no fear. She had not gone a
hundred paces under the arching limes,
when she was met by a band of robbers,
who stopped her and asked what she did
in their forest, and what she carried in her
bag. They were fierce, black-bearded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
men, armed to the teeth with daggers,
cutlasses, pistols, dirks, hangers, blunderbusses,
and other defensive weapons; but
the princess gazed calmly on them, and
said haughtily,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has your grandmother sold her mangle
yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The effect was magical. The robbers
started back in dismay, crying, &ldquo;The
countersign!&rdquo; Then they hastily lowered
their weapons, and assuming attitudes
of abject humility, besought the princess
graciously to accompany them to their
master&rsquo;s presence. With a lofty gesture
she signified assent, and the cringing,
trembling bandits led her on through the
forest till they reached an open glade,
into which the sunbeams glanced right
merrily. Here, under a broad oak-tree
which stood in the centre of the glade,
reclined a man of gigantic stature and
commanding mien, with a whole armory
of weapons displayed upon his person.
Hastening to their chief, the robbers
conveyed to him, in agitated whispers,
the circumstance of their meeting the
princess, and of her unexpected reply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
to their questions. Hardly seeming to
credit their statement, the gigantic chieftain
sprang to his feet, and advancing
toward the princess with a respectful
reverence, begged her to repeat the remark
which had so disturbed his men. With
a royal air, and in clear and ringing tones,
the princess repeated,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Has</em> your grandmother sold her mangle
yet?&rdquo; and gazed steadfastly at the robber
chief.</p>

<p>He turned deadly pale, and staggered
against a tree, which alone prevented him
from falling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;We are
undone! The enemy is without doubt
close at hand, and all is over. Yet,&rdquo;
he added with more firmness, and with
an appealing glance at the princess, &ldquo;yet
there may be one chance left for us. If
this gracious lady will consent to go forward,
instead of returning through the
wood, we may yet escape with our lives.
Noble princess!&rdquo; and here he and the
whole band assumed attitudes of supplication,
&ldquo;consider, I pray you, whether
it would really add to your happiness to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
betray to the advancing army a few poor
foresters, who earn their bread by the
sweat of their brow. Here,&rdquo; he continued,
hastily drawing something from a hole
in the oak-tree, &ldquo;is a bag containing ten
thousand sapphires, each as large as a
pullet&rsquo;s egg. If you will graciously deign
to accept them, and to pursue your
journey in the direction I shall indicate,
the Red Chief of the Rustywhanger will
be your slave forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The princess, who of course knew that
there was no army in the neighborhood,
and who moreover did not in the least
care which way she went, assented to the
Red Chief&rsquo;s proposition, and taking the
bag of sapphires, bowed her farewell
to the grateful robbers, and followed their
leader down a ferny path which led to the
farther end of the forest. When they
came to the open country, the robber
chieftain took his leave of the princess,
with profound bows and many protestations
of devotion, and returned to his
band, who were already preparing to
plunge into the impenetrable thickets of
the midforest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>The princess, meantime, with her two
bags of gems on her shoulders, fared
forward with a light heart, by dale and
by down, through moss and through
meadow. By-and-by she came to a fair
high palace, built all of marble and
shining jasper, with smooth lawns about
it, and sunny gardens of roses and gillyflowers,
from which the air blew so sweet
that it was a pleasure to breathe it. The
princess stood still for a moment, to taste
the sweetness of this air, and to look her
fill at so fair a spot; and as she stood
there, it chanced that the palace-gates
opened, and the young king rode out with
his court, to go a-catching of nighthawks.</p>

<p>Now when the king saw a right fair
princess standing alone at his palace-gate,
her rich garments dusty and travel-stained,
and two heavy sacks hung upon her
shoulders, he was filled with amazement;
and leaping from his steed, like the gallant
knight that he was, he besought her to tell
him whence she came and whither she
was going, and in what way he might
be of service to her.</p>

<p>But the princess looked down at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
little dusty shoes, and answered never a
word; for she had seen at the first glance
how fair and goodly a king this was, and
she would not ask him the price of butter,
nor whether his grandmother had sold her
mangle yet. But she thought in her heart,
&ldquo;Now, I have never, in all my life, seen
a man to whom I would so willingly say,
&lsquo;With all my heart!&rsquo; if he should ask
me to marry him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king marvelled much at her silence,
and presently repeated his questions, adding,
&ldquo;And what do you carry so carefully
in those two sacks, which seem over-heavy
for your delicate shoulders?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still holding her eyes downcast, the
princess took a ruby from one bag, and
a sapphire from the other, and in silence
handed them to the king, for she willed
that he should know she was no beggar,
even though her shoes were dusty. Thereat
all the nobles were filled with amazement,
for no such gems had ever been seen in
that country.</p>

<p>But the king looked steadfastly at the
princess, and said, &ldquo;Rubies are fine, and
sapphires are fair; but, maiden, if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
could but see those eyes of yours, I warrant
that the gems would look pale and dull
beside them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that the princess raised her clear
dark eyes, and looked at the king and
smiled; and the glance of her eyes pierced
straight to his heart, so that he fell on his
knees and cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! sweet princess, now do I know
that thou art the love for whom I have
waited so long, and whom I have sought
through so many lands. Give me thy
white hand, and tell me, either by word
or by sign, that thou wilt be my queen
and my bride!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the princess, like a right royal
maiden as she was, looked him straight
in the eyes, and giving him her little
white hand, answered bravely, &ldquo;<em>With
all my heart!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/drop106_h.png" width="104" height="128" alt="H" title="H" />
</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Hokey Pokey</span> was the
youngest of a large family
of children. His elder
brothers, as they grew up,
all became either butchers
or bakers or makers of
candle-sticks, for such was the custom of
the family. But Hokey Pokey would be
none of these things; so when he was grown
to be a tall youth he went to his father
and said, &ldquo;Give me my fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will you be a butcher?&rsquo; asked
his father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Hokey Pokey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will you be a baker?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will you make candlesticks?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nor that either.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said his father, &lsquo;this is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
only fortune I can give you;&rsquo; and with
that he took up his cudgel and gave the
youth a stout beating. &lsquo;Now you cannot
complain that I gave you nothing,&rsquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That is true,&rsquo; said Hokey Pokey.
&lsquo;But give me also the wooden mallet
which lies on the shelf, and I will make
my way through the world.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His father gave him the mallet, glad
to be so easily rid of him, and Hokey
Pokey went out into the world to seek his
fortune. He walked all day, and at nightfall
he came to a small village. Feeling
hungry, he went into a baker&rsquo;s shop,
intending to buy a loaf of bread for his
supper. There was a great noise and
confusion in the back part of the shop;
and on going to see what was the matter,
he found the baker on his knees beside
a large box or chest, which he was trying
with might and main to keep shut. But
there was something inside the box which
was trying just as hard to get out, and
it screamed and kicked, and pushed the
lid up as often as the baker shut it down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What have you there in the box?&rsquo;
asked Hokey Pokey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have my wife,&rsquo; replied the baker.
&lsquo;She is so frightfully ill-tempered that
whenever I am going to bake bread I
am obliged to shut her up in this box,
lest she push me into the oven and bake
me with the bread, as she has often
threatened to do. But to-day she has
broken the lock of the box, and I know
not how to keep her down.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That is easily managed,&rsquo; said Hokey
Pokey. &lsquo;Do you but tell her, when she
asks who I am, that I am a giant with
three heads, and all will be well.&rsquo; So
saying, he took his wooden mallet and
dealt three tremendous blows on the box,
saying in a loud voice,&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&lsquo;Hickory Hox!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sit by the box,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waiting to give you a few of my knocks.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Husband, husband! whom have you
there?&rsquo; cried the wife in terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; said the baker; &lsquo;it is a frightful
giant with three heads. He is sitting
by the box, and if you open it so much
as the width of your little finger, he will
pull you out and beat you to powder.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;When the wife heard that she crouched
down in the box, and said never a word,
for she was afraid of her life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The baker then took Hokey Pokey
into the other part of the shop, thanked
him warmly, and gave him a good supper
and a bed. The next morning he gave
him for a present the finest loaf of bread
in his shop, which was shaped like a large
round ball; and Hokey Pokey, after
knocking once more on the lid of the box,
continued his travels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had not gone far before he came
to another village, and wishing to inquire
his way he entered the first shop he came
to, which proved to be that of a confectioner.
The shop was full of the most
beautiful sweetmeats imaginable, and
everything was bright and gay; but the
confectioner himself sat upon a bench,
weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What ails you, friend?&rsquo; asked Hokey
Pokey; &lsquo;and why do you weep, when
you are surrounded by the most delightful
things in the world?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; replied the confectioner.
&lsquo;That is just the cause of my trouble.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
The sweetmeats that I make are so good
that their fame has spread far and wide,
and the Rat King, hearing of them, has
taken up his abode in my cellar. Every
night he comes up and eats all the sweetmeats
I have made the day before. There
is no comfort in my life, and I am thinking
of becoming a rope-maker and hanging
myself with the first rope I make.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you set a trap for him?&rsquo;
asked Hokey Pokey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have set fifty-nine traps,&rsquo; replied
the confectioner, &lsquo;but he is so strong that
he breaks them all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Poison him,&rsquo; suggested Hokey Pokey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He dislikes poison,&rsquo; said the confectioner,
&lsquo;and will not take it in any
form.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In that case,&rsquo; said Hokey Pokey,
&lsquo;leave him to me. Go away, and hide
yourself for a few minutes, and all will
be well.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The confectioner retired behind a large
screen, having first showed Hokey Pokey
the hole of the Rat King, which was
certainly a very large one. Hokey Pokey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
sat down by the hole, with his mallet in his
hand, and said in a squeaking voice,&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&lsquo;Ratly King! Kingly Rat!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here your mate comes pit-a-pat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come and see; the way is free;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear my signal: one! two! three!&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">And he scratched three times on the floor.
Almost immediately the head of a rat
popped up through the hole. He was a
huge rat, quite as large as a cat; but
his size was no help to him, for as soon
as he appeared, Hokey Pokey dealt him
such a blow with his mallet that he fell
down dead without even a squeak. Then
Hokey Pokey called the confectioner, who
came out from behind the screen and
thanked him warmly; he also bade him
choose anything he liked in the shop, in
payment for his services.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Can you match this?&rsquo; asked Hokey
Pokey, showing his round ball of bread.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That can I!&rsquo; said the confectioner;
and he brought out a most beautiful ball,
twice as large as the loaf, composed of
the finest sweetmeats in the world, red
and yellow and white. Hokey Pokey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
took it with many thanks, and then went
on his way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next day he came to a third village
in the streets of which the people were
all running to and fro in the wildest confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; asked Hokey
Pokey, as one man ran directly into his
arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; replied the man. &lsquo;A wild
bull has got into the principal china-shop,
and is breaking all the beautiful dishes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why do you not drive him out?&rsquo;
asked Hokey Pokey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We are afraid to do that,&rsquo; said the
man; &lsquo;but we are running up and down
to express our emotion and sympathy,
and that is something.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Show me the china-shop,&rsquo; said Hokey
Pokey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the man showed him the china-shop;
and there, sure enough, was a
furious bull, making most terrible havoc.
He was dancing up and down on a Dresden
dinner set, and butting at the Chinese
mandarins, and switching down finger-bowls
and teapots with his tail, bellowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
meanwhile in the most outrageous manner.
The floor was covered with broken crockery,
and the whole scene was melancholy to
behold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now when Hokey Pokey saw this,
he said to the owner of the china-shop,
who was tearing his hair in a frenzy of
despair, &lsquo;Stop tearing your hair, which
is indeed a senseless occupation, and I
will manage this matter for you. Bring
me a red cotton umbrella, and all will
yet be well.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the china-shop man brought him
a red cotton umbrella, and Hokey Pokey
began to open and shut it violently in front
of the door. When the bull saw that, he
stopped dancing on the Dresden dinner
set and came charging out of the shop,
straight towards the red umbrella. When
he came near enough, Hokey Pokey
dropped the umbrella, and raising his
wooden mallet hit the bull such a blow on
the muzzle that he fell down dead, and
never bellowed again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The people all flung up their hats, and
cheered, and ran up and down all the
more, to express their gratification. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
for the china-shop man, he threw his arms
round Hokey Pokey&rsquo;s neck, called him
his cherished preserver, and bade him
choose anything that was left in his shop
in payment for his services.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Can you match these?&rsquo; asked Hokey
Pokey, holding up the loaf of bread and
the ball of sweetmeats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That can I,&rsquo; said the shop-man;
and he brought out a huge ball of solid
ivory, inlaid with gold and silver, and truly
lovely to behold. It was very heavy,
being twice as large as the ball of sweetmeats;
but Hokey Pokey took it, and,
after thanking the shop-man and receiving
his thanks in return, he proceeded on his
way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After walking for several days, he
came to a fair, large castle, in front of
which sat a man on horseback. When
the man saw Hokey Pokey, he called out,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who are you, and what do you bring
to the mighty Dragon, lord of this castle?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hokey Pokey is my name,&rsquo; replied
the youth, &lsquo;and strange things do I bring.
But what does the mighty Dragon want,
for example?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He wants something new to eat,&rsquo;
said the man on horseback. &lsquo;He has eaten
of everything that is known in the world,
and pines for something new. He who
brings him a new dish, never before tasted
by him, shall have a thousand crowns
and a new jacket; but he who fails, after
three trials, shall have his jacket taken
away from him, and his head cut off
besides.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I bring strange food,&rsquo; said Hokey
Pokey. &lsquo;Let me pass in, that I may
serve the mighty Dragon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the man on horseback lowered
his lance, and let him pass in, and in short
space he came before the mighty Dragon.
The Dragon sat on a silver throne, with
a golden knife in one hand, and a golden
fork in the other. Around him were many
people, who offered him dishes of every
description; but he would none of them,
for he had tasted them all before; and he
howled with hunger on his silver throne.
Then came forward Hokey Pokey, and
said boldly,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here come I, Hokey Pokey, bringing
strange food for the mighty Dragon.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Dragon howled again, and waving
his knife and fork, bade Hokey Pokey
give the food to the attendants, that they
might serve him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not so,&rsquo; said Hokey Pokey. &lsquo;I
must serve you myself, most mighty Dragon,
else you shall not taste of my food. Therefore
put down your knife and fork, and
open your mouth, and you shall see what
you shall see.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the Dragon, after summoning the
man-with-the-thousand-crowns and the
man-with-the-new-jacket to one side of
his throne, and the man-to-take-away-the
old-jacket and the executioner to the
other, laid down his knife and fork and
opened his mouth. Hokey Pokey stepped
lightly forward, and dropped the round
loaf down the great red throat. The
Dragon shut his jaws together with a snap,
and swallowed the loaf in two gulps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That is good,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;but it is
not new. I have eaten much bread, though
never before in a round loaf. Have you
anything more? Or shall the man take
away your jacket?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have this, an it please you,&rsquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Hokey Pokey; and he dropped the ball
of sweetmeats into the Dragon&rsquo;s mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the Dragon tasted this, he rolled
his eyes round and round, and was speechless
with delight for some time. At
length he said, &lsquo;Worthy youth, this is
very good; it is extremely good; it is
better than anything I ever tasted. Nevertheless,
it is not new; for I have tasted
the same kind of thing before, only not
nearly so good. And now, unless you are
positively sure that you have something
new for your third trial, you really might
as well take off your jacket; and the
executioner shall take off your head at
the same time, as it is getting rather late.
Executioner, do your&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Craving your pardon, most mighty
Dragon,&rsquo; said Hokey Pokey, &lsquo;I will first
make my third trial;&rsquo; and with that he
dropped the ivory ball into the Dragon&rsquo;s
mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gug-wugg-gllll-grrr!&rsquo; said the Dragon,
for the ball had stuck fast, being too
big for him to swallow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Hokey Pokey lifted his mallet
and struck one tremendous blow upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the ball, driving it far down the throat
of the monster, and killing him most
fatally dead. He rolled off the throne
like a scaly log, and his crown fell off and
rolled to Hokey Pokey&rsquo;s feet. The youth
picked it up and put it on his own head,
and then called the people about him and
addressed them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;People,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I am Hokey Pokey,
and I have come from a far land to rule
over you. Your Dragon have I slain,
and now I am your king; and if you will
always do exactly what I tell you to do,
you will have no further trouble.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So the people threw up their caps
and cried, &lsquo;Long live Hokey Pokey!&rsquo;
and they always did exactly as he told
them, and had no further trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Hokey Pokey sent for his three
brothers, and made them Chief Butcher,
Chief Baker, and Chief Candlestick-maker
of his kingdom. But to his father he sent
a large cudgel made of pure gold, with
these words engraved on it: &lsquo;Now you
cannot complain that I have given you
nothing!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you would,&rdquo; said the Angel; &ldquo;a

<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said the child. &ldquo;Mother gave
me this skein to wind, and I promised to
do it. But then father sent me on an
errand, and it was almost school-time, and
I was studying my lesson and going on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>

<p>&ldquo;But father sent me on an errand!&rdquo;
said the child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong class="smcap">Sit Down!</strong>&rdquo; said the Angel; and he
took the child by her shoulders and set her
down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now sit still!&rdquo; he said, and he began
patiently to wind up the skein. It was
wofully tangled, and knotted about the
child&rsquo;s hands and feet; it was a wonder
she could move at all; but at last it was
all clear, and the Angel handed her the
ball.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you so very much!&rdquo; said the
child. &ldquo;I was not naughty, was I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not naughty, only foolish; but that
does just as much harm sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I was doing right things!&rdquo; said
the child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But you were doing them in the wrong

but when you have a skein to wind you
must sit still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see!&rdquo; said the Angel. He put out a
strong white hand, and taking the man by
the collar, tumbled him neck and crop into
the ditch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; cried
the man, as he scrambled out breathless
and dripping. &ldquo;I never saw such behavior.
Do you see what you have done?
you have ruined my clothes, and nearly
drowned me beside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; said the Angel: &ldquo;this is the
way <em>I</em> was made.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Some</span> neighbours were
walking together in the
cool of the day, watching
the fall of the twilight,

on fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the direction, that must be
our neighbour William&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; said one.
&ldquo;Ought we not to warn him of the
danger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see only a little flame,&rdquo; said another;
&ldquo;perchance it may go out of itself, and no
harm done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be loth to carry ill news,&rdquo; said
a third; &ldquo;it is always a painful thing to
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;William is not a man who welcomes
interference,&rdquo; said a fourth. &ldquo;I should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>

<div class="figleft">

</div>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> door of the
Comet House was
open. In the great
court-yard stood
hundreds of comets,
of all sizes and
shapes. Some were
puffing and blowing, and arranging their
tails, all ready to start; others had just
come in, and looked shabby and forlorn
after their long journeyings, their tails
drooping disconsolately; while others still
were switched off on side-tracks, where
the tinker and the tailor were attending
to their wants, and setting them to rights.
In the midst of all stood the Comet Master,
with his hands behind him, holding a very
long stick with a very sharp point. The
comets knew just how the point of that
stick felt, for they were prodded with it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
whenever they misbehaved themselves;
accordingly, they all remained very quiet,
while he gave his orders for the day.</p>

<p>In a distant corner of the court-yard
lay an old comet, with his tail comfortably
curled up around him. He was too old
to go out, so he enjoyed himself at home
in a quiet way. Beside him stood a very
young comet, with a very short tail. He
was quivering with excitement, and occasionally
cast sharp impatient glances at
the Comet Master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will he <em>never</em> call me?&rdquo; he exclaimed,
but in an undertone, so that only his companion
could hear. &ldquo;He knows I am
dying to go out, and for that very reason
he pays no attention to me. I dare not
leave my place, for you know what he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the old comet, slowly,
&ldquo;if you had been out as often as I have,
you would not be in such a hurry. Hot,
tiresome work, <em>I</em> call it. And what does
it all amount to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, that&rsquo;s the point!&rdquo; exclaimed the
young comet. &ldquo;What <em>does</em> it all amount
to? That is what I am determined to find
out. I cannot understand your going on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
travelling and travelling, and never finding
out why you do it. <em>I</em> shall find out,
you may be very sure, before I have
finished my first journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better not! better not!&rdquo; answered
the old comet. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll only get into
trouble. Nobody knows except the Comet
Master and the Sun. The Master would
cut you up into inch pieces if you asked
him, and the Sun&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what about the Sun?&rdquo; asked
the young comet, eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Short-tailed Comet No. 73!&rdquo; rang
suddenly, clear and sharp, through the
court-yard.</p>

<p>The young comet started as if he had
been shot, and in three bounds he stood
before the Comet Master, who looked
fixedly at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have never been out before,&rdquo;
said the Master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; replied No. 73; and he
knew better than to add another word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will go out now,&rdquo; said the Comet
Master. &ldquo;You will travel for thirteen
weeks and three days, and will then return.
You will avoid the neighborhood of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Sun, the Earth, and the planet Bungo.
You will turn to the left on meeting other
comets, and you are not allowed to speak
to meteors. These are your orders. Go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the word, the comet shot out of the
gate and off into space, his short tail
bobbing as he went.</p>

<p>Ah! here was something worth living
for. No longer shut up in that tiresome
court-yard, waiting for one&rsquo;s tail to grow,
but out in the free, open, boundless realm
of space, with leave to shoot about here
and there and everywhere&mdash;well, <em>nearly</em>
everywhere&mdash;for thirteen whole weeks!
Ah, what a glorious prospect! How swiftly
he moved! How well his tail looked, even
though it was still rather short! What
a fine fellow he was, altogether!</p>

<p>For two or three weeks our comet was
the happiest creature in all space; too
happy to think of anything except the
joy of frisking about. But by-and-by
he began to wonder about things, and that
is always dangerous for a comet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder, now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why I
may not go near the planet Bungo. I
have always heard that he was the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
interesting of all the planets. And the
Sun! how I <em>should</em> like to know a little
more about the Sun! And, by the way,
that reminds me that all this time I have
never found out <em>why</em> I am travelling. It
shows how I have been enjoying myself,
that I have forgotten it so long; but now
I must certainly make a point of finding
out. Hello! there comes Long-Tail No.
45. I mean to ask him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he turned out to the left, and waited
till No. 45 came along. The latter was
a middle-aged comet, very large, and with
an uncommonly long tail,&mdash;quite preposterously
long, our little No. 73 thought,
as he shook his own tail and tried to make
as much of it as possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Long-Tail!&rdquo; he
said as soon as the other was within speaking
distance. &ldquo;Would you be so very good
as to tell me what you are travelling for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For six months,&rdquo; answered No. 45
with a puff and a snort. &ldquo;Started a
month ago; five months still to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean that!&rdquo; exclaimed
Short-Tail No. 73. &ldquo;I mean <em>why</em> are
you travelling at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Comet Master sent me!&rdquo; replied No.
45, briefly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what for?&rdquo; persisted the little
comet. &ldquo;What is it all about? What
good does it do? <em>Why</em> do we travel for
weeks and months and years? That&rsquo;s
what I want to find out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure!&rdquo; said the
elder, still more shortly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s more,
don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little comet fairly shook with amazement
and indignation. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;Is it possible? And how
long, may I ask, have you been travelling
hither and thither through space, without
knowing or caring why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long enough to learn not to ask
stupid questions!&rdquo; answered Long-Tail
No. 45. &ldquo;Good morning to you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And without another word he was off,
with his preposterously long tail spreading
itself like a luminous fan behind him.
The little comet looked after him for some
time in silence. At last he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, <em>I</em> call that simply <em>disgusting</em>!
An ignorant, narrow-minded old&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, cousin!&rdquo; called a clear merry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
voice just behind him. &ldquo;How goes it
with you? Shall we travel together? Our
roads seem to go in the same direction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The comet turned and saw a bright and
sparkling meteor. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;must not
speak to you!&rdquo; said No. 73, confusedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not speak to me!&rdquo; exclaimed the
meteor, laughing. &ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the
matter? What have I done? I never saw
you before in my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-nothing that I know of,&rdquo; answered
No. 73, still more confused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why mustn&rsquo;t you speak to me?&rdquo;
persisted the meteor, giving a little skip
and jump. &ldquo;Eh? tell me that, will you?
<em>Why</em> mustn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;know!&rdquo; answered the
little comet, slowly, for he was ashamed
to say boldly, as he ought to have done,
that it was against the orders of the Comet
Master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, gammon!&rdquo; cried the meteor,
with another skip. &ldquo;<em>I</em> know! Comet
Master, eh? But a fine high-spirited
young fellow like you isn&rsquo;t going to be
afraid of that old tyrant. Come along,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
I say! If there were any <em>real reason</em> why
you should not speak to me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I say,&rdquo; interrupted
the comet, eagerly. &ldquo;What <strong>IS</strong> the
reason? Why don&rsquo;t they tell it to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause there isn&rsquo;t any!&rdquo; rejoined
the meteor. &ldquo;Come along!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a little more hesitation, the comet
yielded, and the two frisked merrily along,
side by side. As they went, No. 73 confided
all his vexations to his new friend,
who sympathized warmly with him, and
spoke in most disrespectful terms of the
Comet Master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pretty sort of person to dictate
to you, when he hasn&rsquo;t the smallest sign
of a tail himself! I wouldn&rsquo;t submit
to it!&rdquo; cried the meteor. &ldquo;As to the
other orders, some of them are not so bad.
Of course, nobody would want to go near
that stupid, poky Earth, if he could
possibly help it; and the planet Bungo
is&mdash;ah&mdash;is not a very nice planet, I
believe.&rdquo; [The fact is, the planet Bungo
contains a large reform-school for unruly
meteors, but our friend made no mention
of that.] &ldquo;But as for the Sun,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
bright, jolly, delightful Sun,&mdash;why, I
am going to take a nearer look at him
myself. Come on! We will go together,
in spite of the Comet Master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the little comet hesitated and
demurred; but after all, he had already
broken one rule, and why not another?
He would be punished in any case, and
he might as well get all the pleasure he
could. Reasoning thus, he yielded once
more to the persuasions of the meteor,
and together they shot through the great
space-world, taking their way straight
toward the Sun.</p>

<p>When the Sun saw them coming, he
smiled and seemed much pleased. He
stirred his fire, and shook his shining
locks, and blazed brighter and brighter,
hotter and hotter. The heat seemed to
have a strange effect on the comet, for he
began to go faster and faster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; said the meteor. &ldquo;Why
are you hurrying so? I cannot keep up
with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot stop myself!&rdquo; cried No. 73.
&ldquo;Something is drawing me forward, faster
and faster!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>On he went at a terrible rate, the meteor
following as best he might. Several planets
that he passed shouted to him in warning
tones, but he could not hear what they
said. The Sun stirred his fire again, and
blazed brighter and brighter, hotter and
hotter; and onward rushed the wretched
little comet, faster and faster, faster and
faster!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catch hold of my tail and stop me!&rdquo;
he shrieked to the meteor. &ldquo;I am shrivelling,
burning up, in this fearful heat!
Stop me, for pity&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the meteor was already far behind,
and had stopped short to watch his companion&rsquo;s
headlong progress. And now,&mdash;ah,
me!&mdash;now the Sun opened his huge
fiery mouth. The comet made one desperate
effort to stop himself, but it was
in vain. An awful, headlong plunge
through the intervening space; a hissing
and crackling; a shriek,&mdash;and the fiery
jaws had closed on Short-Tail No. 73
forever!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said the meteor. &ldquo;How
very shocking! I quite forgot that the
Sun ate comets. I must be off, or I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
get an æon in the Reform School for this.
I am really very sorry, for he was a nice
little comet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And away frisked the meteor, and soon
forgot all about it.</p>

<p>But in the great court-yard in front of
the Comet House, the Master took a piece
of chalk, and crossed out No. 73 from the
list of short-tailed comets on the slate
that hangs on the door. Then he called
out, &ldquo;No. 1 Express, come forward!&rdquo;
and the swiftest of all the comets stood
before him, brilliant and beautiful, with a
bewildering magnificence of tail. The
Comet Master spoke sharply and decidedly,
as usual, but not unkindly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. 73, Short-Tail,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has
disobeyed orders, and has in consequence
been devoured by the Sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here there was a great sensation among
the comets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. 1,&rdquo; continued the Master, &ldquo;you
will start immediately, and travel until
you find a runaway meteor, with a red
face and blue hair. You are permitted
to make inquiries of respectable bodies,
such as planets or satellites. When found,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
you will arrest him and take him to the
planet Bungo. My compliments to the
Meteor Keeper, and I shall be obliged
if he will give this meteor two æons in the
Reform School. I trust,&rdquo; he continued,
turning to the assembled comets, &ldquo;that
this will be a lesson to all of you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I believe it was.</p>
